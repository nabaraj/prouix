# prouix
Sitecore frontend setup

How to run this setup on your machine

Install node.js from the official site
Download the prouix folder onto your system
Run 'npm install' to install dependencies to run prouix
Run 'node server' on your command prompt/terminal by staying on the root directory of prouix
Fill in all details and your folder will be ready at the given path.
Now your project folder is ready. You can commit this to your repo for others to use.
Now your work with prouix is done so you can close it

Now this part is where you start working on your generated files.
Install bower, git & grunt-cli globally before getting project dependencies.
Also bower gives a git error if you do direct install so give this command on your terminal
git config --global url."https://".insteadOf git://

Run 'npm install and bower install' on your terminal root directory to install dependencies for the front end.

Now for sass we need to install ruby and its gems
Download ruby from official site
While installing add it to the path
Then install compass that is required to compile sass by giving 'gem install compass'

Now your setup is done and you can run 'grunt server' to get your server up and running which will reload if any changes to the files are done.
